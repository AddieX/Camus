    <h3>Happiness in the view of Albert Camus</h3>
    <p class="Camus-Happnies">
      In Camus's works, happiness can be observed as the subjective perception of existence of human beings on earth,
      despite
      the metaphysical meaninglessness of the world. The search for any deeper meaning to life is hopeless and takes us
      away
      from the awe and wonder we can feel as we respect life and admire existence: it is “the essential impulse for the
      human
      drama.”, And In Camus's philosophy as in his novels, happiness is the way of life rather than its aim, since life
      has no metaphysical
      depth. In order to feel it, one needs simply to realize that there is nothing more to search for than the
      experience of
      life itself. Human nature, if there is such nature, is confined to this appreciation of life as all there is. This
      realization of life comes from itself, as we only know from our experience of ourselves and our experience of the
      world:
      “This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it
      exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction.” The absurd is the condition in which the human
      mind
      is trapped: to seek rational explanations in an irrational world. Camus agreed with the Phenomenology of Husserl
      on the
      importance of a return to human perception: “Thinking is learning all over again to see… What justifies thought is
      its
      extreme consciousness.” Though, he rejected the outcome of Husserl's method: that it eventually states a depth and
      meaning in existence (what he calls “philosophical suicide”). Yet, there is still a remarkable sensibility and
      appeal to
      perception in his writings. I suggest that this nonetheless phenomenological approach has an emotional dimension
      which,
      for Camus, is linked to happiness. That is to say, human beings must perceive the world to become aware of their
      condition and accept it, since it is the only good that they can find, though it is not a “consolation” for the
      absence
      of a deeper meaning. Although he denied any answer to the fundamental question of the meaning of life, such answer
      seems
      to lie in the feeling of happiness itself.
